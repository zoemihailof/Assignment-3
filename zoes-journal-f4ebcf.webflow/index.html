          <h1 class="heading-5">BLOG REFLECTION</h1>
          <p class="paragraph-3">In IXXN211, my primary goal is to acquire a comprehensive understanding of web development, with a particular focus on CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS plays a vital role in determining the visual appeal and user experience of a website.I want to become proficient in crafting aesthetically pleasing, responsive, and user-friendly designs. This involves learning the intricacies of CSS, including its properties, selectors, and best practices. Beyond just the technical aspects, I also aim to delve into the art of building a successful website. This entails learning about user experience (UX) design, information architecture, and the psychology behind effective web design. I want to create websites that not only look great but also function intuitively and provide value to their visitors.One of my key motivations for taking this course is the desire to make meaningful connections through the websites I build. A successful website should resonate with its audience, whether that audience is looking for information, products, or a sense of community. I&#x27;m eager to explore the strategies and techniques for creating websites that engage, inform, and connect with users on a deeper level.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-7">During week two of the course, we delved into the fascinating history of web design, focusing on the period from 1990 to 1998. It was truly eye-opening to discover the humble beginnings of the World Wide Web, which emerged in 1990, and how it rapidly evolved. One of the key milestones that caught my attention was the creation of the first 18 HTML tags in 1991. These tags laid the foundation for web development as we know it today, serving as the building blocks for websites and online content. It&#x27;s astonishing to think about how far we&#x27;ve come from those early days. However, what intrigued me the most during this week&#x27;s lecture was the revelation that Google, now a global tech giant, began as a research project with the sole purpose of improving the quality of search results through a mathematical algorithm. This underlines the transformative power of innovation and how a simple idea can evolve into something that reshapes the digital landscape.</p>

        <h1 class="heading-9">WEEK 3- BLOG REFLECTION</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-8">Week 3 of the course provided a  continuation of the history of web design, focusing on the years from 1998 to 2008. This period was marked by significant developments that reshaped the digital landscape. It was intriguing to learn about some of these key milestones. One of the highlights was the birth of Wikipedia, a revolutionary concept that allowed users from around the world to collaborate and share knowledge. This open platform changed the way we access information. <br><br>Another development during this time was the advent of SVG (Scalable VectorGraphics), which brought a new level of flexibility and quality to web graphics. This technology has played a pivotal role in the visual appeal of websites and the versatility of web design. Partially responsive websites, with Audi&#x27;s pioneering integration by the digital agency Razorfish, marked a shift towards more adaptive and user-friendly web design. It&#x27;s interesting to see how this evolution in design principles has led to the responsive web design we know today, which ensures a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes. In the realm of social media, it was captivating to learn about the origins of platforms like Twitter, initially known as &quot;Twitta.&quot; The emergence of Twitter in 2006 and the subsequent introduction of the iPhone in 2007 revolutionized the entire industry. The way we connect, communicate, and access information was forever changed by these innovations.<br><br> The workshop activity for the week involved creating a Venn diagram based on a user persona. This hands-on exercise allowed us to apply our knowledge and skills in understanding and representing the needs and characteristics of our target audience. Presenting these Venn diagrams to the class was a valuable experience as it encouraged collaboration and provided an opportunity to receive feedback and insights from peers, which is essential in the field of web design. </p>

        <p class="paragraph-9">Week four marked further exploration of the history of web design. This period, spanning the late 20th and early 21st centuries, was a time of rapid technological advancement, and it was particularly intriguing to learn about key innovations that have had a profound impact on the design industry.<br><br> One of the highlights of this week&#x27;s study was the introduction of Adobe and Figma, two design software applications that have become integral to the work of modern designers. As someone who uses these tools on a daily basis, I couldn&#x27;t help but reflect on the significance of their creation during this era. Adobe and Figma have not only streamlined the design process but have also expanded the possibilities for creativity and collaboration, making them indispensable resources for designers around the world. It&#x27;s a testament to how technology can empower and transform the field of design. <br><br>In addition to this, our class also focused on customer journey maps. These maps provide a structured visual representation of the distinct stages that customers go through when interacting with a product or service. At each stage, customers engage in specific activities that shape their overall experience. What makes journey mapping even more insightful is the inclusion of emotions and experiences that customers feel throughout their interaction. These emotions have a direct influence on how customers perceive a product or service. <br><br>Customer journey mapping is a great tool for designers seeking to improve the user experience. By gaining a deep understanding of how customers move through each stage, designers can identify pain points, areas of delight, and opportunities for enhancement. This information allows designers to create more user-centric and impactful designs that resonate with the target audience.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-10">The content for week 5 was based on part 1 of CSS grids. The CSS Grid Layout module is indeed a powerful tool in web design,offering a more flexible and efficient way to structure and position elementson a webpage compared to traditional methods like tables. It provides severaladvantages that make it a preferred choice for modern web layouts.

        <h1 class="heading-11">BLOG REFLECTION</h1>
        <p class="paragraph-10">Reflecting on this class, I initially felt daunted by the concept of CSS grids, especially because I don&#x27;t consider myself a coding expert. However, as I delved deeper into the subject matter, I was pleasantly surprised by how this module provided a more simplified and user-friendly approach to web design. It offered an in-depth exploration of CSS grids that gradually demystified the complexities I initially perceived. One of the key takeaways from this class was the user-friendly nature of CSS grids. They allow designers, even those with limited coding experience, to create complex layouts with relative ease. The structured grid system, which is reminiscent of tables but significantly more flexible, helped me visualise and understand the relationships between elements on a webpage.  Week 5&#x27;s class emphasised not only the &quot;how&quot; but also the &quot;why&quot; ofCSS grids. It&#x27;s not merely about implementing a grid layout; it&#x27;s about understanding the logic behind it and how it can enhance the user experience.This approach resonated with me as it encouraged a deeper comprehension of the subject matter. The gradual learning curve and the opportunity to practice and apply CSS grids in various exercises and assignments were invaluable. It allowed me to build confidence in my abilities and witness the immediate impact of grid layouts on web design.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-13">Week 5 of the course turned out to be a comprehensive dive into not only CSS grids but also the vital aspects of colour, typography, and web accessibility. These elements are integral to creating not just visually appealing websites, but also inclusive and user-friendly digital experiences. The exploration of colour in web design was enlightening. Learning about monochromatic schemes, analogous colour schemes, and complementary colours provided a wealth of insights into how to use colour effectively. Moreover, understanding the emotional impact of colours on users is a powerful tool for designers. The ability to convey different emotions and messages through colour choices is a valuable skill in crafting compelling web experiences. Perhaps the most eye-opening part of the week was the focus on web accessibility. The realization that web design extends beyond aesthetics and into inclusivity was a game-changer. The website &quot;Whocanuse&quot; shed light on the diverse accessibility needs of individuals, including those with visual impairments.Understanding how different vision issues, such as protanomaly, affect colour perception was a revelation. &quot;Whocanuse&quot; opened my eyes to the importance of making websites accessible to everyone, regardless of the irabilities. It&#x27;s a perspective that I&#x27;ll carry forward, ensuring my future designs are considerate of diverse accessibility needs. Typography also took center stage this week. We learned how the choice of fonts and style scan create a hierarchy that guides users through content. Familiarizing ourselves with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) reinforced the significance of typography in making websites readable and navigable for all users.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-15">Week 7 proved to be an important point in our journey of mastering web design. This time, our focus shifted towards the importance of composition and the essential elements that shape the user experience on a website. The lecture and class delved deep into several aspects that are integral in creating visually appealing and functional web designs. <br><br>One of the core themes of the week was &quot;composition.&quot; This encompassed various elements, each playing a crucial role in how we structure and present information on a webpage. We explored topics such as grids, visual hierarchy, colour and typography, scale, white space, and balance. These elements are like the building blocks of an effective website layout, and understanding how to use them cohesively can have a positive impact on user engagement and overall aesthetics. The week&#x27;s lessons reinforced the importance of not only what we place on a page but also how we arrange it. <br><br>Moving beyond the visual aspects of composition, the class then delved into the concept of &quot;affordances.&quot; Affordances are essentially cues or signals that tell users how to interact with various elements on a webpage. This includes buttons, links, call-to-action elements, input fields, icons, and even the language we use in UX (User Experience) copy. Understanding and utilizing affordances effectively is paramount in ensuring that users can easily navigate a website and perform the desired actions. A well-designed affordance provides users with a clear indication of what to do and how to do it. <br><br>This week&#x27;s focus on composition and affordances served as a valuable reminder that web design is not just about aesthetics; it&#x27;s about creating a seamless and intuitive user experience. It&#x27;s about guiding users through the content, facilitating their interactions, and ultimately achieving the goals of the website, whether it&#x27;s making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or accessing information.<br><br> As I reflect on this week&#x27;s lessons, I&#x27;m increasingly aware of the multifaceted nature of web design. It&#x27;s a blend of creativity, psychology, and functionality. It&#x27;s about finding the right balance between visual appeal and user-centered design. I look forward to applying these newfound insights in my future web design projects, striving to create not just beautiful websites, but also websites that are a easy for users to explore and engage with. The journey continues, and with each week, I&#x27;m one step closer to becoming a more proficient and well-rounded web designer.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-16">For week 9  we delved into the topic of responsive design. In today&#x27;s digital landscape, where an array of devices and screen sizes are in use, the ability to create adaptable websites is a necessity. Our lesson emphasized the importance of ensuring that the websites we create can adapt to a wide range of devices. The concept of responsive design involves more than just aesthetics; it&#x27;s about delivering a consistent and user-friendly experience, whether someone is visiting a site from a desktop computer, a tablet, or a smartphone.<br><br> We explored various testing methods to verify the responsiveness of a website.Device emulation allowed us to simulate how a site would appear on different devices, while cross-browser testing ensured compatibility with various web browsers. Usability testing, an essential part of the process, helped identify any issues users might encounter when navigating the site. These testing methods serve as check points in the design and development process, helping us create websites that are truly adaptable and accessible.<br><br> In the second part of the lecture, we dived into the topic of file organization. This is an aspect of web design that might be overlooked but holds significance. Consistent and well-structured file organization is essential for efficiency, collaboration, and maintaining a project&#x27;s integrity over time. It involves creating organized project folders, naming conventions, effectively managing project assets, and maintaining clear and helpful documentation. These practices contribute to better project management and collaboration. It&#x27;s an area that I personally recognize I need to improve upon, as it can stream line the design and development process.<br><br> Lastly, the lecture showed the importance of alt text, a concept that carries significant weight in the realm of web accessibility. Writing alt text is not just a best practice; it&#x27;s a critical component in providing an inclusive user experience. Alt text serves several vital purposes. It provides a textual description of images, making content accessible to those with visual impairments. Additionally, it enhances search engine optimization (SEO) by providing context to search engines. By creating meaningful and descriptive alttext, we ensure that our websites are accessible to a wider audience and can be easily discovered through online searches.</p>

    <p class="paragraph-19">How am I going with assignment 2.2 so far? As the course progresses, I&#x27;m becoming more proficient with Webflow, thanks to YouTube tutorials tailored to my specific needs for the Love Matcha Club website. This week, I focused on creating a logo, establishing a colour palette, and choosing appropriate typography. These elements are pivotal in branding, and I&#x27;ve finalised them to align perfectly with the website&#x27;s identity. <br><br>The process has been both creative and strategic. I&#x27;ve considered how colour choices evoke emotions and convey the message of the Love Matcha Club. Typography plays a significant role in creating visual hierarchy and guiding users through the content. The logo, in particular, has been a central focal point, as it is often the first element that users encounter and remember. It has to be distinctive and reflect the essence of the brand. <br><br>In the coming weeks, I&#x27;ll shift my focus to content hierarchy and layout. Structuring the content effectively is crucial for user-friendliness and navigation. I&#x27;m eager to move forward and continue developing the Love Matcha Club website, building on the knowledge and skills I&#x27;ve acquired in this course.</p>
